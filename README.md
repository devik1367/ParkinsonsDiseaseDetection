4. Devi Krishnan

Required libraries:
We used Python 3. The following packages are required before execution of the code:
Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib.


How to execute the code:

1. To a)run the SVR model for regression and b)find the optimal threshold for motor UPDRS:
Type "python3 main.py" into the command line (make sure you are in the directory containing the code).

2. To run the MLP model for regression:
Type "python3 mlp.py" into the command line.

3. To run the multivariate linear regression model:
Type "python3 multiple_linear_regression.py" into the command line.
